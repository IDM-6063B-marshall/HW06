I used the [Beijing Air Quality data](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2024F-B/DM-GY-6063-2024F-B.github.io/blob/main/assets/homework/06/Beijing-PM2.5/README.md) for this project. I spent some time looking for data about juries because this summer I was a juror on a [5 week criminal trial](https://www.businessinsider.com/fahim-saleh-death-killer-tyrese-haspil-emotions-may-sway-verdict-2024-6), but I could only find existing data visualizations and not raw data. I also thought about doing the Tree Census data but I had fewer ideas about how I would represent non-numeric data. 

I thought that air quality might be interesting because I could represent a potential correlation between things like temperature and pollution. These were the parameters of the dataset I ended up using. There were about 48,000 entries in total. The size of each ellipse represents the amount of pollution in the air, while the color of the circles represents the color (red is hotter, black is colder). I also made each circle slightly transparent so that the individual data points would be slightly more visible.
